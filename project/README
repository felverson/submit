========== LJ Simulation of Argon ==========

All code is in python3

All values are in reduced units unless otherwise stated ---

==== Inputs ====

||| particle_data: .txt file, must be formatted as follows:

position_x position_y position_z velocity_x velocity_y velocity_z mass particle_label

The position and velocity values can be set to zero as the code will place the particles and 
give them appropriate velocities

||| parameter_data: .txt file, must be formatted as follows:

no_of_particles no_of_simulation_steps timestep cutoff_radius temperature density

==== Outputs ====

||| traj_out: .xyz file, VMD compatible format:

no_of_particles \\ point_number \\ label x_pos y_pos z_pos \\

||| obsv_out: .txt file, formatted as follows:

KE PE E_total \\ MSD \\ RDF \\

=== Running the code ===

The command in the terminal should be as follows:
python3 particle_manybody.py particle_datafile parameter_datafile traj_out obsv_out

The code will show three plots, for RDF, MSD, and energy respectively.

=== Units ===

The code takes values in reduced units. Included is a unit converter, called
'unit_converter.py', which converts values from metric to reduced units.

=== Example trajectories ===

Included are three trajectory files, and three observable files, for solid, liquid, and gas. 
The parameters used for each simulation are as follows:

Solid: 	Density: 1.1887		(20 cm^3/mol)
	Temperature: 0.62604 	(75 K)

Liquid: Density: 0.63397	(37.5 cm^3/mol)
	Temperature: 1.08514	(130 K)

Gas:	Density: 0.0339628574	   (700 cm^3/mol)
	Temperature: 1.585976628   (190 K)
